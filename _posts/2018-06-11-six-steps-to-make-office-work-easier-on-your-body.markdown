# Desk height according to your own height

Setting the desk height according to your own height is the basis of a good work environment setup. You can find a calculator for the desk height [here](desk_height_calculator). It also informs you about the chair height.

What I use: an Ikea Skarsta desk, which has a crank to set the height.

# Computer screen top-aligned with your eyes

The top of the screen area should be at the height of your eyes when sitting upright. If you get this right then you have a good starting point that stimulates you to sit in a more 'open' position instead of hunched over or leaning backwards.

| Too low <sup>1</sup> | Too high <sup>2</sup> | Correct <sup>3</sup>

A laptop screen is too small for comfortable viewing. It's best to pair your laptop or PC with a computer monitor that has a good contrast (IPS technology or better). Such a screen is cheap and can last a decade. You don't need a screen that is much larger than 22 inches in diagonal if you learn how to use [multiple workspaces](gnome_shell). Staring left and right for longer periods is a strain on your eyes and neck.

What I use: an Ikea Sigfinn bamboo monitor stand with an LG 24 inch IPS screen (24MP48HQ-P).

# Keyboard with feel and feedback

Laptop keyboards are too small to comfortably position your hands and fingers. The keys also prevent locating which buttons are which by feel alone. The best keyboard is a mechanical keyboard where each key has its own separate stable switch underneath. Regular keyboards are mushy in their downpress and don't provide clear feedback about when the press was performed.

What I use: a Logitech MasterKeys S keyboard with Cherry MX brown switches and O-ring rubber dampeners under the keys.

# Precise mouse

A modern mouse with a high resolution sensor makes it easier to select things on your screen than a regular mouse does, which allows your hand to be less cramped.

What I use: a Razer Atheris mouse with USB dongle (it can do Bluetooth too).

# Don't click when you don't have to

There is a Chrome plugin called [Vimium][vimium] which allow you to use the keyboard for selecting elements on the screen instead of clicking on them. There are also shortcuts for scrolling up and down and many more. You can save 25% or more clicks a day using this tool. It takes a short while to get the hang of it, but then you get a lifetime of benefits (or until we stop using keyboards).

# Writing without pressure on the paper

The ball of a ballpoint pen needs to be pressed against the paper as it moves to get an adequete line of ink. A nib pen delivers ink to the paper on contact. A fountain pen is a nib pen with an internal reservoir.

What I use: a set of Pilot Kakuno fountain pens. A medium width nib with blue/black ink for writing and a thin width nib with red color for annotating.
