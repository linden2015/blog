If you work behind a computer daily, and many of us do, then you better get your 'battlestation' optimized for your physical body or else you risk injuring your muscles, tendons and nerves. Doing this also enhances your productivity because you'll feel less uncomfortable in such a position.

# Screen

If a computer screen is too small, you will tend to sit too close to it in a hunched over position. If a screen is too big you'll hold your neck in an twisted position for too long.

The top of the screen area should be [at the height of your eyes][wiki-ergonomics-pic] when sitting upright.

I use an LG 22" IPS screen on top of an Ikea SIGFINN monitor stand.

# Keyboard

Laptop keyboards are too small too comfortably position your hands; your hands are forced too close together. The keys are also cramped together which prevents easily locating which buttons are which by feel alone. The best keyboard is a mechanical keyboard where each key has its own separate stable switch underneath. Regular keyboards are mushy in their downpress (unpredictable) and don't provide clear feedback about when the press was performed.

I use the Logitech MasterKeys S. There are many other good ones.

# Mouse

A modern mouse with a high resolution sensor makes it easier to select the things on your screen than a regular mouse does, which allows your hand to be less cramped.

I use a Razer Atheris. The Logitech MX series also comes highly recommended by many.

# Don't click when you don't have to

There is a Chrome plugin called [Vimium][vimium] which allow you to use the keyboard for selecting elements on the screen instead of clicking on them. There are also shortcuts for scrolling up and down and many more. You can save 25% or more clicks a day using this technique. It takes a short while to get the hang of it, but then you get a lifetime of benefits (or until we stop using keyboards).

# No ballpens

A ballpen requires pressure to get ink out of it. A flowing motion over the paper is all a fountain pen needs to write.

I use a Pilot Kakuno, which is a cute pen designed for Japanese school children. I use two: one medium (blue) and one thin (red) for annotations.
